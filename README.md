# CCDC-Onboarding

This repository contains the challenges  which are to be solved by the students who are interested in joining the team.

## Overview 

Just as a general overview:

Know what you're getting yourself into. The CCDC competition is a high-speed high-stress blue teaming competition that will overwhelm you if you don't keep up with the tasks and work assigned to you. The only way that the team can win is if everyone pulls their own weight. The team members MUST work with one another. You cannot do this solo. You must be willing to work with other people. Communication skills are essential. Documentation skills are also needed. You must be able to write down what you're doing and why you're doing something. 

## Background Information

With the ground rules out the way, I'm going to give some more rules regarding how the tryouts should play out:

    1) These tasks were all done by the current members of the CCDC team. So, to make sure you're right there with us, you must complete at minimum, the AIR FORCE challenge. You can also do the other. It's recommended if you want us to take you seriously. 

    2) Put your best effort into this, you are competing with one another. The CCDC competition will only accept at most 12 people on a roster. 

    3) When you begin working on your tasks, we encourage you to ask questions. HOWEVER, do NOT send us questions that can be solved by a 2-second Google Search. Before you send the question, ask yourself "Have I spent at least 30 minutes googling and trying things?". Struggling is the natural process of this. Got an error message? Google it. Is a concept not clear? Google or Youtube it. There's a ton of resources out there that will give you the answers.

## Overall 

Overall:
    1) Put in the work. We want the people that are WILLING and HUNGRY to WIN. We have had complete beginners come in that have put in the work and have become very successful in being part of the team and being in leadership positions. 

    2) You're signing up for Tuesdays at 7pm in person at WAN 445 and then Fridays at 6:30pm. These sessions usually last 1.5 - 2 hours MINIMUM. You're making a time commitment. Weekends are also in play. Winter break? Yep. We're going to be working hard during this. It's all going to be beneficial in the end as you could be recruited by some company that is watching and gain a career in this. 

    3) The longer that you wait to submit, the less likely it is that you'll be accepted. The faster you can submit an ACCURATE representation of your work and the task, the higher chance you have at competing.
